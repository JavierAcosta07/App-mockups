### Login 
This is the representation of the login itself. The user enters the email and password that they have previously registered during the sign-up process. In case they haven't registered yet, there is a section below the button that is underlined, allowing them to register. If the user is registered and enters the correct information, they only need to press the button that says "Login" to access the app.

It involves entering the full name, email address, password, and finally, confirming the password to avoid mistakes. Lastly, there is the "Register" button, which saves the user-entered data, allowing them to log in normally afterward.

### main page 
This is a representation of the main page of the store itself, showing recommended products at the beginning when you enter.

Additionally, you can access settings to edit your data. In the bottom center, there is a large button with a shopping cart icon, which obviously takes us to the shopping cart. Finally, the items displayed in the tiles are clickable to view the product in more detail and add it to the shopping cart.

### Shopping Cart
This is the representation of the Shopping Cart, which is the space where the items the user wants to purchase are stored. Here, the user can select the quantity of each item using the arrow next to the number. It also displays an image on the left to confirm if the item is correct. The three dots next to each item provide the option to remove the item if the user no longer wants it. There is also an arrow in the top left corner that allows the user to return to the main page, in case they need to add more items for a single payment. Finally, there is the checkout button for proceeding to payment.

### Card Facts
This is the representation for filling in information for the card (Debit or Credit). It also provides an illustration of the location of the CVV, as many users may not be aware of its placement. Following that, there are other details such as the owner's full name, card numbers, and expiration date. After completing this information, the user can proceed to confirm the payment and authorize it.

### Address Facts
This is the representation for the data of an address where the purchased items will be delivered. If the user hasn't saved it before and it's the first time in this section, they can save it for future use. If it's already saved, they can also edit it or add a new address. The required information includes the recipient's name, postal code, state, and municipality of the property or location, the neighborhood, street, and building number. There's also an option to mark whether it's a home or workplace, depending on how the user considers it. Finally, once the data is filled out, the user saves the address and completes the transaction.
