## App Mockups 

### Login
In the login, you can see two fields for "Address" and "Password". When the user enters this information, they access the main page. However, if the user doesn't have an account, they can click on the bottom where it says "Register" to input all their details and create an account. Additionally, they can use their linked Google account to sign in directly to the app.

</p>

### Register
Afterwards, we have the "Register" button, which allows the user to provide their information to the page and log in. The user also has the option to register a Google account using the Google button or do it manually. In the event that they are already registered, they can simply click on the "Log in" section to enter the app directly.

</p>


### Main Page
Next, we have the "Main Page," which is the first page the user sees upon entering the app after logging in. Here, the user will find sections for recommendations and offers that the page has for them. Additionally, notifications are displayed in the bell icon at the bottom right, along with user settings at the top left in the user icon. In the middle is the section where the user can directly access the "Shopping Cart."

</p>

### Filter 
At the top of the "Main Page," there is the search bar, which is used to look for items that the user needs or is searching for. This page filters what the user wants and displays it accordingly.

</p>

### Shopping Cart 
In this section is the "Shopping Cart." The user can see what they've added to the cart and view the total cost of the items they are about to purchase. Additionally, they can control the quantities of each item or remove an item they no longer want. Once the user has everything they want, they can proceed to payment by clicking on the button at the bottom center.

</p>

### Payment Methods 
The "Payment methods" is where the application displays the payment options it offers. In general, these include options such as paying in cash at an associated store – using examples like OXXO or a deposit – or using a bank-associated card, either debit or credit.

</p>

### Credit/Debit Card's Fields 
The "Credit/Debit Card's Fields" is after selecting a payment method, in the case that it is a credit or debit card. Here, the user enters the card details and the owner's name. After inputting all the information correctly, it proceeds to verification and the next screen if everything is in order.

</p>

### Address's Fields
The "Address's Fields" is where the user enters their address information for the first time or for a location to which they haven't sent items before. In other words, once the user enters the details of an address, they are saved, and the user can edit them in case of any errors. After this, the shipping information is saved, and the user can proceed to purchase the product. This means that everything is set up for ordering the desired item from the user.

</p>

### Objet's Card
Finally, there is the "Objet's Card," which displays the description and the item that the user is purchasing, along with the price and options for paying in installments or not. It also has the option to report the listing in case there is any error for it to be resolved. Additionally, the user can add the item to the cart, where the button is located at the bottom center.
